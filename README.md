# Laura Duffy’s Portfolio

## Description 

This web application offers my deployed portfolio of work samples. Users can read a brief “About Me” section then click on links that lead them to samples of my work.  The layout is simple but offers engaging images and animation; it is also easy to use.  

The web application itself is part of the portfolio in that it was coded from scratch. This project allowed me to apply flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables as well as to further develop fluency in HTML and CSS in general.
